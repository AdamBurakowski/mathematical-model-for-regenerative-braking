# mathematical-model-for-regenerative-braking
This is a model used for calculating how much energy can be recovered through regenerative braking systems. The project provides a mathematical framework for simulating deceleration, energy recovery efficiency, and key forces acting on a vehicle during braking. It includes customizable parameters such as drag coefficient, rolling resistance, and road slope. The model is implemented in Python and visualizes results for better understanding.
